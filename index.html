		<p>High Concept: Play as a doctor and be able to collect as many human organs as you possibly can while only being able to donate them to 100 patients.
<p>Player Experience Goals: Experience being in a doctor's dream to donate human organs. Imagine how awesome it would be to give a certain patient an organ and being able to see the patient's tag number. 
After you reach 100 patients, the game is over and reverts to the start screen. When the doctor collects an organ, you get 50 points added to your score The same goes for giving the organs to the patients The thrill of getting a higher score in each game just keeps getting better. It was so good that I became somewhat addicted to it.
<p>Strategies: move around the screen to pick up as many human organs as you can as they are flying past you. Keep yourself relaxed as you give each organ to each of the 100 patients.
Fixed: Forget the above, the strategy will depend on how many organs you collect and can possibly donate to various patients.
Many organs will be of a fake variety and not help the patients 
The game will end when you collect between 240 and 600 fake organs.
The game will depend on luck, chance, and randomness.  
Difference:
added in fake organs
copied photos to use them again in parts of my code
Restricted player movements so the player could be strategic in reaching the highest score in one iteration
<p>Genre: Side Scroller, Endless Runner
<p>Game play: point your character, using a mouse, to collect human organs and give them to patients
In the polish, use up,down,left,right keys to move your character and can only move up to part of the whole game
<p>Target Audience: this game is for people who love cars and racing video games.  
For people over the age of eight. It has simple controls but has advanced mechanics. 
<p>Prototype: This game is a version of space shooter that someone else had made. The game is using up, down, left, and right arrows to play I wanted to make the game so that bullets never had to be fired. I wanted to do a minimalistic design that involved moving the character to pick up human organs and give them to patients who are floating around.
This is a polish 
<p>Setting/Premise: takes place in an Umbrella Corporation facility that deals with human organs for cash.
<p>Story: Dominic Toretto has fallen into a dream after Brian's death. He gets flashbacks after seeing those Toyota Supras because
Brian drove that car.  Dom fights for his life in the dream, trying to be as rich as he can.  What he gets in that dream comes to his income in real life.
<p>Prototype Assets: From Google images, modified in Piskel. Made my own background 
<p>Prototype Closest Other Game: Borrowed from space shooter and modified it.
